Introduction
============

RESThub JS is a Javascript micro framework, built on top of jQuery, intended to give you usually needed functionnalities
to build large application that scales well.

It is freely inspired and based on best Javascript code/plugins found on Open Source projects, more specifically on :
 * Sammy.JS : RESThub route and storage plugins are directly inspired from Sammy ones. Sammy is too much for our need and not really MVC oriented, but is a great source of inspiration.
 * Javascript MVC : too big and complex for our need, but our class implementation come from JavascriptMVC one, and our controller is inspired from their too.

You can test RESThub JS functionnalities in your browser by going to the `RESThub JS test page <http://resthub.org/javascript/test/>`_. Source code of these test are available from RESThub JS GitHub repository. You can run them with mvn jetty:run and go to `http://localhost:8080/test/ <http://localhost:8080/test/>`_ URL (http:// mode, mostly usefull with Chrome that has difficulties with file:// mode)


Check these sample applications to learn how to design your RESThub based web application :

* `Roundtable <https://github.com/pullrequest/resthub/tree/master/resthub-apps/roundtable/>`_ : a doodle like clone.
* `Booking JS <https://github.com/pullrequest/resthub/tree/master/resthub-apps/booking/booking-js/>`_ : booking demo application, implemented with Javascript stack
