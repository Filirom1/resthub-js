Introduction
------------

RESThub JS is a Javascript micro framework, built on top of jQuery, intended to give you usually needed functionnalities
to build large application that scales well.

It is freely inspired and based on best Javascript code/plugins found on Open Source projects, more specifically on :
 * Sammy.JS : RESThub route and storage plugins are directly inspired from Sammy ones. Sammy is too much for our need and not really MVC oriented, but is a great source of inspiration.
 * Javascript MVC : too big and complex for our need, but our class implementation come from JavascriptMVC one, and our controller is inspired from their too.
